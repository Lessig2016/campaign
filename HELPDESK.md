# Help Desk Protocol

## Introduction

The LESSIG2016.US tech team provides a 24x7 helpdesk for technical and content requests from the strategic/business members of campaign.

## Types of Tickets and SLAs

We support four types of tickets:

1. Minor copy changes to the web site (SLA = 2 hours)
1. New press release (SLA = 3 hours)
1. New blog post (SLA = 6 hours)
1. New mass email blast (SLA = 6 hours)

SLA clock stops when helpdesk staff are waiting for answers on content details.  We are hopeful to meet SLA on 90% of tasks.

## Process for submitting tickets

Your email must first be set up on the helpdesk.  If you are not sure if you've been set up, contact chris@lessigforpresident.com or just try to open a helpdesk request on the email below.

Email your request to [x+45273984948124@mail.asana.com](mailto:x+45273984948124@mail.asana.com). Please indicate the type of request (see above) in the subject line and include as much detail as possible in the message body.

Keep an eye on your email inbox after submitting a ticket because you will likely get a response quickly, especially if more information is needed.

## Process for handling tickets
