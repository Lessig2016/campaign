# Lessig.us (lessigforpresident.com)

We've decided to keep this repository closed-source for two reasons:

1. We used a [commercial wordpress theme](http://themeforest.net/item/jupiter-multipurpose-responsive-theme/5177775), so open-sourcing it would vioate terms of the [license agreeemnt](http://themeforest.net/licenses/terms/regular).
1. Outside of theme customizations, most of the code lives in the WordPress database, so having an open-source repository doesn't benefit us or the opensource community.

We look forward to collaborating with the open source community on our other projects: [authservice](http://github.com/Lessig2016/authservice), [pledgeservice](http://github.com/Lessig2016/pledgeservice), [teams](http://github.com/Lessig2016/teams), [yourstory](http://github.com/Lessig2016/yourstory)
